```matlab
function result = myFunction(x)
  % This function is supposed to calculate the square of a number.
  % However, it contains a common error.
  result = x ^ 2; 
  % The bug is in the usage of the '^' operator. This operator does not handle
  % correctly complex numbers that could be passed as input parameter x.
  % for example, if we pass x = 2+3i, then result will be:
  % result = -5 + 12i; 
  % but the actual square is:
  % (2+3i)*(2+3i) = 4 + 6i + 6i -9 = -5 + 12i which is correct.
  % however, this code will give an incorrect result for other inputs.
  % for example, if x = 2-3i, then result is:
  % result = -5 - 12i
  % but (2-3i)*(2-3i) = 4 - 6i - 6i + 9 = 13 -12i which is different.

  %To handle the complex numbers correctly, use the element-wise power operator .
  % instead of ^.
